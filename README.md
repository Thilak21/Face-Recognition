# Face Detection

# Project Overview

The Face Detection System is an advanced computer vision project that utilizes Python and OpenCV to detect and locate human faces within images and video streams. This project showcases
my ability to work with machine learning techniques, computer vision libraries, and real-time data processing. By implementing pre-trained deep learning models like Haar Cascade 
Classifiers, the system is able to deliver fast and accurate face detection, making it suitable for applications in security systems, automated photo organization, or user interaction tools.

# Key Features

- **Real-time Face Detection**: Efficient face detection from live video streams or static images.
- **Multi-Face Detection**: Supports detecting multiple faces within a single image or video frame.
- **Bounding Box Visualization**: Draws bounding boxes around detected faces to highlight them.
- **Customizable Output**: Offers options to save processed images, display results, or stream video with live face detection.
- **Scalable**: The system can be extended for other face-related tasks like facial recognition or emotion detection.

# Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for implementing the project.
- **OpenCV**: A powerful computer vision library that provides tools for face detection and image processing.
- **Haar Cascade Classifier**: A pre-trained machine learning model that detects faces with high accuracy.
- **NumPy**: For efficient array and matrix operations.

# Project Highlights

- **Real-Time Processing**: The system processes live video input (e.g., webcam) in real-time to detect faces.
- **Ease of Use**: Simple and intuitive interface with easy setup and execution.
- **Optimized for Performance**: The project is designed to handle face detection efficiently, making it suitable for real-time applications.

# How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:

      git clone https://github.com/Thilak21/Face-Recognition.git
    

2. **Install required libraries**:

             pip install opencv-python
   
             pip install opencv-contrib-python
   
             pip install numpy
    

4. **Run the system**:

     a) Create data sets:
   
             Create the datasets by your image or anyother image and store in the dataset folder

         In powershell

                      python create_data.py

     b) To detect faces in an image and in a video stream (webcam), use:

                      python faceRecognition.py
    
    

# Learning Outcomes

- Gained experience with OpenCV and computer vision algorithms.
- Developed a strong understanding of image processing techniques.
- Learned how to implement real-time object detection systems.
- Gained proficiency in handling Python dependencies and optimizing code for performance.

# Conclusion
